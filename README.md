### Credits

Starting with react and redux is not a easy task. I was search for the best tools and practices for developing a application that has features like material ui, responsive design, sliding menu etc... There are lots of greate starter kits on the web. Some of the examples in this project are direct copies or modified examples from those starter kids. So I would like to thank all of those making greate starter kids. Having that in mind I'm sharing my starter kid that I will use in future for creating new projects and I hope that it can help other to master react and redux.

### TO DO

- Refactor code to use best practices 
- Add testing
- Implement the internationalisation in the whole project
