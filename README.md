# react-redux-material-starter-kit

This starter kit is designet to give a high start up base for react projects. It uses Redux as the state container. It provides the most common features that you need for the run on a new application, like: navigation and routing, internationalisation, theme design and configuration, responsive design etc... The style is 100% focused on [Google's Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html). 

The primary goal of the project is to be a showcase of how things can be solwed and not how they should or must be solwed. Marking Issues, commenting the structure or whole concept and making contributions are very welcome :)

### Credits

Starting with react and redux is not a easy task. I was search for the best tools and practices for developing a application that has features like material ui, responsive design, sliding menu etc... There are lots of greate starter kits on the web. Some of the examples in this project are direct copies or modified examples from those starter kids. So I would like to thank all of those making greate starter kids. Having that in mind I'm sharing my starter kid that I will use in future for creating new projects and I hope that it can help other to master react and redux.

### TO DO

- Refactor code to use best practices 
- Add testing
- Implement the internationalisation in the whole project
